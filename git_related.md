# Git Related Resources

This is a collection of git related resources I've found helpful along
my journey as a software developer.

1. The Git Style Guide - A brief explanation of how to format branches,
   commits, and messages
   * [https://github.com/agis/git-style-guide]

2. A note about commit messages - This explains how to write more
   lengthy commit messages using your preferred editor. This was listed
   as a reference in The Git Style Guide, listed above, but I found it
   worthy of it's own reference.
